# Foundation Web App

Hello! Thanks for visiting! 

This is a Responsive Web App designed for a foundation responsible of helping kids in Uganda. 
I took this project because I believe in helping others and to give back to the community.

One of the main features of this Web App is the Donate-Slider-Window that is available on
every page and can be accessed without redirecting the user to a different page. This gives
the opportunity for the user to help with a donation while learning about the foundation's endeavors.

Please, go ahead and take a look at the web app: https://foundationpage.netlify.app/

Happy coding!

Julio

## Description

The front-end of this project was developed with the usage of React.js for the pages and it's components, the styling was made with React Styled components
for reusable components implementation. No back-end has been implemented on the Contact page or Donate Slide Window.

For the 'Image Carousel' I used React's UseRef() and UseState() Hooks combined with DOM manipulation.

Also, to make the page responsive I used CSS's media querys. These are some samples of the web app:
